# <em>VENUS</em>: A Novel Visualization for Quantum State Representation   

![ScreenShot](/public/venus_twoq.png)

VENUS is a novel visual design for quantum state representation. By explicitly correlating 2D geometric shapes based on the math
foundation of quantum computing characteristics, VENUS effectively visualizes quantum states of both the single qubit and two qubits for quantum entanglement. Also, we use multiple coordinated semicircles to naturally encode probability distribution, making the quantum superposition intuitive and easy to understand.      


### Description    
Visualizations have played a crucial role in helping quantum computing users explore quantum states in various quantum computing
applications. Among them, Bloch Sphere is the widely-used visualization for showing quantum states. However, it cannot reveal
quantum entanglement and superposition, the two essential properties of quantum computing. To address this issue, we propose
VENUS, a novel visualization for quantum state representation. By explicitly correlating 2D geometric shapes based on the math
foundation of quantum computing characteristics, VENUS effectively visualizes quantum states of both the single qubit and two qubits for quantum entanglement. Also, we use multiple coordinated semicircles to naturally encode probability distribution, making the quantum superposition intuitive and easy to understand. We conducted two case studies and an in-depth expert interview to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of VENUS. The result shows that VENUS can effectively facilitate the exploration of quantum states for the single qubit and two entangled qubits.    

### System     

You can access the online visual analytics system via this [link](https://venus-interface.github.io/).  


### Value  

- By working closely with five domain experts, we collect and summarize the design requirements for visualizing the quantum states.   
- We present a novel visualization, VENUS, to tackle both quantum superposition and quantum entanglement representation challenges for both single-qubit and two-qubit with multiple visually correlated 2D geometric shapes.   
- We conduct two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 14 quantum computing experts to demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of VENUS.
